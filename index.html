        <p class="intro" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Biomedical Text Mining at National University of Defense Technology is conducted
            in the Computer Science Department. The group consists of 2 faculty who serve as principal investigators on multiple projects,
            and who advise graduate students at all levels. We focuse on extracting knowledge from biomedical texts (including biomedical
            papers, clinical records, FDA reports and so on), building knowledge graph and helping medical staff make better decision through
            inference.Our research benefits from close collaboration with Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University in related
            fields such as drug-drug interaction and targeted drug therapy.To learn more about our group, visit our Labs, Groups and Projects page.

        <p class="intro" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is based on Hadoop ecology maintenance, adding HBase and Hive to manage structured
            or unstructured data to facilitate the storage of SQL, NoSQL data. Existing text, audio, video, pictures, links, applets
            and other data resources. In the near future, we hope to complete the tagging of WeChat groups through the data in the
            current and near-term plans. Focusing on the goal of group tagging, the following subdivided goals have been subdivided
            in the previous period:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="topic">1. High frequency word classification statistics.</span><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-frequency words are extracted from the group's internal chat messages, group
            information, etc., and high-frequency words are categorized into statistics to form the distribution of high-frequency words.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="topic">2. Group user relationship chain analysis.</span><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group membership information and intra-group user interaction relationship are analyzed
            and classified to form a hierarchy of user relationship chains.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="topic">3. Analyze the core circle in the group.</span><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through intra-group chat messages, statistical analysis was conducted to find
            out the degree of user interaction within the group and the core users in the group.
